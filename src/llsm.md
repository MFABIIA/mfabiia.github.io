# Lattice Light Sheet Microscope
 
Bessel beam light sheet microscope with gentle illumination
designed for 3D, high-speed cell biological applications {.lead}

### Unique System Features
- High speed imaging for live samples with frame rates near 300 slices per second 
- Significant reduction of photobleaching and phototoxicity due to use of focal-plane illumination
- Excellent optical sectioning capability (sheet thickness typically <600 nm)
- In ideal samples, capable of 230 x 230 x 370 nm X-Y-Z resolution
- Volumetric field of view approximately 50 x 100 x 50 µm X-Y-Z
- Capable of imaging approximately 50-70 µm deep in large specimens, e.g. Drosophila or zebrafish embryos
- Two sCMOS cameras for FRET imaging
- Rapp-Opto photomanipulation rig for performing photo-activation, FRAP, and photo-ablation
- CO2, humidity, and temp control with Oko Labs system
